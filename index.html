			<h2>Meet the Examiner</h2>
			<p>
				Before Polygraph Clarification and Professional Services, Derick started his career in the South African Police Force in the Crime Prevention Unit; their aim was preventing and eradicating all street crime viz drugs, car thefts, house breaking, etc. This unit received a high success rate during the eighties. From this unit he was recruited to the Security Police Division; he also successfully completed the Bomb Disposal Expert Course, next to the Task Team one of the most sought after units in the Police Force.

				In 1994, Derick entered the private sector obtaining various diplomas in Warehouse Management; Industrial Relations and Security Management. He built up experience in these fields by working for private companies; however, felt the calling to his original expertise and began doing investigations mainly but not limited to insurance claims. This was a stepping stone to where he finds himself today, Polygraph; as he saw the success rate Polygraph achieves and joined the profession.

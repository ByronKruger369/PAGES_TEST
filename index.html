			<h2>Meet the Examiner</h2>
			<p>
				Before Polygraph Clarification and Professional Services, Derick started his career in the South African Police Force in the Crime Prevention Unit; their aim was preventing and eradicating all street crime viz drugs, car thefts, house breaking, etc. This unit received a high success rate during the eighties. From this unit he was recruited to the Security Police Division; he also successfully completed the Bomb Disposal Expert Course, next to the Task Team one of the most sought after units in the Police Force.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1994, Derick entered the private sector obtaining various diplomas in Warehouse Management; Industrial Relations and Security Management. He built up experience in these fields by working for private companies; however, felt the calling to his original expertise and began doing investigations mainly but not limited to insurance claims. This was a stepping stone to where he finds himself today, Polygraph; as he saw the success rate Polygraph achieves and joined the profession.
